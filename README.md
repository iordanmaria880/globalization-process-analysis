# analiza-procesului-de-globalizare

This project examines the impact of globalization on the Romanian economy, focusing on the labor market. It combines a theoretical overview with economic analysis tools (PESTELE, POPIT, SWOT, Porter’s Five Forces, BCG Matrix, McKinsey Matrix, MoSCoW analysis, and macroeconomic indicators) to identify globalization’s effects on the structure and dynamics of Romania’s labor market.

The study also proposes solutions and strategies for adapting the national economic system to globalization-driven changes, offering conclusions and guidance for sustainable development.
